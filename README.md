# Curated list of useful python tricks. 

I created this repo to make a collection of all useful Python based algorithms and some tricks i have been using of-late and which could be useful for everyone. 


## Algorithms
- [Fibonacci sequence](/fibonacci.py) A function which gives the sum of Fibonacci numbers from 0 to n.
- [Sum of a sequence](/sum.py) A simple idea of using arguments. 
- [Check Palindrome](/palindrome.py) Function that returns all the palindromes from a string.
- [Recursion](/try_recursion.py) Implementation of a recursive function. 
- [Duplicates](/check_duplicates.py) Checks for duplicates in a array.


## CodeWars
Codewars is the best resource to practice coding. Here are some of my solutions. 
- [Who likes](/codewars/who_likes.py) Get the number of likes from a string and parse it. 
- [Filter lists](/codewars/list_filtering.py) Function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings as inputs and returns a new list with string filtered out. 
- [Name Abbrevation](/codewars/name_to_initial.py) Function to convert a name into initials.

## Object oriented python (*work in progress*)
The Object Oriented part covers the following parts:
- Classes and instances.
