# Curated list of useful python tricks. 

I created this repo to make a collection of all useful Python based [Algorithms](/Algorithms), [Codewars challenges](/codewars), handy [Pandas](/Pandas) tricks useful for day to day Data science workflow. 

---
## Algorithms
- [Fibonacci sequence](/Fibonacci/fibonacci.py) A function which gives the sum of Fibonacci numbers from 0 to n.
- [Fibonacci Fast](/Fibonacci/fibonacci_fast.py) A faster method for Fibonacci instead of using a recursive function. 
- [Fibonacci Last digit](/Fibonacci/fibonacci_last_digit.py) Returns the last digit from a Fibonacci sequence. 
- [Sum of a sequence](/Algorithms/sum.py) A simple idea of using arguments. 
- [Check Palindrome](/Algorithms/palindrome.py) Function that returns all the palindromes from a string.
- [Recursion](/Algorithms/try_recursion.py) Implementation of a recursive function. 
- [Duplicates](/Algorithms/check_duplicates.py) Checks for duplicates in a array.
- [Coin change](Algorithms/change.py) Find the no. of coins needed to change the input value. 

## CodeWars
Codewars is the best resource to practice coding. Here are some of my solutions. 
- [Who likes](/codewars/who_likes.py) Get the number of likes from a string and parse it. 
- [Filter lists](/codewars/list_filtering.py) Function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings as inputs and returns a new list with string filtered out. 
- [Name Abbrevation](/codewars/name_to_initial.py) Function to convert a name into initials.
- [Count Monkeys](/codewars/countmonkeys.py) Elegant solution to count digits from 1 to `n`. 
- [Check square](/codewars/issquare.py) Given a integral number determine if its a square number. 
- [Sum lowest](/codewars/sum_two_lowest.py) A function that returns the sum of the two lowest positive numbers given an array of minimum 4 positive integers. 

## Object oriented python (*work in progress*)
The Object Oriented part covers the following parts:
- Classes and instances.
